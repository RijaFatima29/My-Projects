# My-Projects
This repository is created to share my learning journey in Information Technology. I will be uploading my practice codes, small programs, and notes as I continue to improve my skills in C++ and other IT tools. My goal is to build a strong foundation and gain hands-on experience through online internships and real-world projects.
